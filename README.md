## User Story
When using the application, I want to be able to give and receive advice on posted workouts, or be able to track my exercises.

## Description
The use for this application is fitness whether it be giving advice, posting workouts, or tracking your exercises. Using Mongodb, Express, Apollo GraphQL, Node, and React we built a full stack application. The idea was to develelop a fitness app where users can post workouts and give advice. By using the terminal, we were able to do many things such as retrieve data, store data, and manipulate it.

## Technologies
- **React and Express**: Both technologies React and Express, are used together to create a full stack application, with React running the front-end and Express running the back-end. React uses the routing, controller, models, etc from the server side to be able to create and render data to the front-end. These two can be seperated, so the back-end would connect to a back-end service like Heroku and the front-end would connect to somewhere like Netlify for example.

- **Apollo/GraphQL**: Apollo is a comprehensive GraphQL platform that enables you to build, manage, and scale GraphQL APIs effectively. GraphQL, is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. In our project, Apollo/GraphQL serves as the middleware between the client-side React application and the server-side Express application. It effectively and efficiently does data fetching, type-safe communication, and real-time updates, enhancing the overall performance and user experience of the application.
By using Apollo/GraphQL, we can ensure that our application remains scalable, maintainable, and responsive.

- **Mongodb and ODM Implementation**: Mongodb, is an ODM for Node.js. Mongodb allowed us to translate complex queries into readable javascript code. We were also able to design models and relationships to bridge the gap between object-data modeling and database management. By abstracting database queries, you can ensure consistency and efficient databases with your Node.js applications.

- **Node.js, Apollo/GraphQL, and Mongodb**: Using these technologies we created a server-side run environment. This helps create web applications that can handle several operations at the same time.
