## User Story
When using the application, I want to be able to give and receive advice on posted workouts, or be able to track my exercises.

## Description
The use for this application is fitness whether it be giving advice, posting workouts, or tracking your exercises. Using Mongodb, Express, Apollo graphql, Node, and React we built a full stack application. The idea was to develelop a fitness app where users can post workouts and give advice. By using the terminal, we were able to do many things such as retrieve data, store data, and manipulate it.

## Tech
- **Mongodb and ODM Implementation**: Mongodb, is an ODM for Node.js. Mongodb allowed us to translate complex queries into readable javascript code. We were also able to design models and relationships to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and database management. By abstracting database queries, you can ensure consistency and efficient databases with your Node.js applications.

- **Node.js, Apolloql, and Mongodb**: Using these technologies we created a server-side run environment. This helps create web applications that can handle several operations at the same time.
